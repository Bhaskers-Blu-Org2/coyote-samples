Coyote State Machine Examples
=============================
A collection of examples that show how to use the Coyote state machine programming model
to build and systematically test asynchronous applications.

## Where to start
A great place to start is by going through the **PingPong** and **FailureDetector** examples
which give an introduction to using basic and more advanced features of Coyote.

## Examples
- **PingPong**, a simple application that consists of a client and a server sending ping and pong messages for a number of turns.
- **FailureDetector**, which demonstrates more advanced features of Coyote such as monitors (for specifying global safety and liveness properties) and nondeterministic timers which are controlled during testing.

## How to build
Follow the instructions [here](..).

## How to run
To execute a sample, simply run the corresponding executable, available in the `bin` folder.
