Coyote Examples
===============
A collection of examples that show how to use Coyote to build and systematically test asynchronous applications.

There are two equivalent sets of examples using the two main Coyote programming models:

- [MachineExamples](MachineExamples/README.md) - shows how to use the Coyote `explicit state machine model`
- [AsyncExamples](AsyncExamples/README.md) - shows how to use Coyote to test state machines built using `C# Asynchronous Tasks`.
